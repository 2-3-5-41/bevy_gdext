# Node 3D Puppet Example

**Currently Panics**
Panics do to an invalid `InsatnceId` being returned to the `GodotRef` that holds the primitive mesh instance.

This example spawns a default `Camera3D` with a primitive mesh instance.

## How to run

1. Open this example folder's crate (`meshinstance3d_puppet -> rust`) in your terminal, and run the `cargo build` command to generate the libraries for godot.
2. Open the `project.godot` project into Godot 4 and open in the editor.
3. Run the project.

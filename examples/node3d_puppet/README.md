# Node 3D Puppet Example

To see what is happening, since this example only showcases how to instantiate and free a node & entity from bevy and godot, make sure you are watching the `Remote` scene tree in the godot editor, and watch as there is a new `Node3D` that will be removed from the tree as well as bevy after 10 seconds have elapsed from start.

## How to run

1. Open this example folder's crate (`node3d_puppet -> rust`) in your terminal, and run the `cargo build` commands to generate the libraries for godot.
2. Open the `project.godot` project into Godot 4 and open in the editor.
3. Run the project and watch the `Remote` scene tree.
